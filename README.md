# Face_Emotion_Recognition_Machine_Learning
Face Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning Python

The goal of this project was to develop a CNN based model that can accurately detect and classify human emotions
in real time.

• The emotion gets classified based on 7 emotions: Happy, Disgust, Fear, Anger, Neutral, Sad & Surprise.
• In CNN convolutional, max-pooling, and dropout on fully connected layers are used along with softmax to get
output for 7 emotions .
